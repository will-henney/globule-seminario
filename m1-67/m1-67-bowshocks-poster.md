# Plan for poster to present at Wolf Rayet conference June 2023 Morelia

## Title of poster ##

Pending suggestion from Roberto

We could try a modification of what I put for the proposed paper:

> Shielded from the wind: evaporating neutral globules around a Wolf-Rayet star

## Abstract for poster ##

### Roberto's first version ###

> De las imágenes del JWST y del HST en $H\alpha$ se pueden apreciar con mucho detalle la presencia de cúmulos globulares en la nebulosa M1-67 de la estrella WR-124. A partir de estas observaciones queremos saber como es la interacción entre la presión RAM de la estrella y la presión interna debido al flujo foto-evaporativo de estos cúmulos, durante el estudio de estas interacciones se obtuvieron algunos parámetros físicos en las cáscaras chocadas considerando un modelo estacionario y se pudo conocer mejor la distribución espacial tomando en cuenta el ángulo que tienen los cumulos entre el plano del cielo y el eje de simetría de estos cúmulos.


### Will's translation with minimal corrections ###

> From the JWST and HST images in $H\alpha$, the presence of dense globules in the M1-67 nebula of the star WR-124 can be seen in great detail. We wish to use these  observations in order to study the interaction between the RAM pressure of the stellar wind from the WR star and the internal pressure due to the photoevaporative flow of these globules.  By considering a steady state hydrodynamic model for these interactions, we obtain physical parameters of the collision shells and de-project the spatial distribution of globules, finding that the majority are concentrated in a narrow range of radii: 0.5 +/- 0.1 pc from the star.  

### Abstract that I wrote for the paper ###

We could maybe borrow some phrases from this:

> The circumstellar nebula M1-67 around the Wolf-Rayet star WR~124
> contains hundreds of small neutral globules, as revealed by JWST images.
> However, despite the powerful stellar wind from the star, the globules
> do not interact directly with the wind.
> Instead, they are hydrodynamically shielded by a transonic warm ionized
> flow away from their surfaces that is induced by the Lyman continuum radiation
> of the star.
> This inwardly directed photoevaporation flow shocks against the
> outflowing stellar wind to form dense hemispherical ionized shells
> that are a few times larger than the globules
> and which contribute a significant fraction of the recombination line luminosity
> of the nebula.
> We analyze archival HST images of the nebula and estimate the size, brightness,
> and ionized density of each photoevaporation flow and accompanying interaction shell.
> We show that \textit{something, something, something, \dots}.
> We compare the globule-wind interaction around WR~124 with similar interactions
> seen elsewhere, such as photoevaporating disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula.

### Final merged version
