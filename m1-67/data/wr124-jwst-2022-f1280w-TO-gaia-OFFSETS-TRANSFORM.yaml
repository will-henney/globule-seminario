info: 'Linear transform coefficients to convert between two coordinate frames

  The transform was calculated by fitting robust linear models to the offsets between
  the two frames as a function of position on the sky. The norm used for M-estimation
  was the trimmed mean with c=3.0.

  The constant offset is in coeff_0 in milliarcsecond. This can be added to the CRVAL
  WCS parameter. The associated uncertainty is in e_coeff_0.

  The linear terms (dilation, rotation, shear) are given by the matrix coeff_1. This
  can be added to the identity matrix and then multiply the CD WCS matrix. The associated
  uncertainty is in e_coeff_1.'
