 
* Circumstellar nebula M1-67 around the Wolf Rayet star WR124



** Measuring the knots
- Region file
  - [[file:../../../Work/WR124-HST/m1-67-globules.reg]]
- Number of globules: 169
- Number of isolated globules where we can hope to measure the shell: 49
** HST images
- [[file:MAST_wr124.json]] has a list  of the files that I have downloaded
  - These are the Level 3 products from the HLA of the WFPC2 observations, plus the Level 2 products from the FOC in the UV
  - On my laptop I have put the data files in file:/Users/will/Work/WR124-HST/

*** Available datasets
- I have got some images from HLA in the following filters
  - F656N
    - Two epochs
  - F555W
  - F675W
- They are badly contaminated by CRs, and I am not sure if these are the best observations or not
- It seems like the second F656N image I have is much better
  - Yes, this is the second epoch 2008-06
  - [2023-05-05 Fri] I am now using this image to mark the globules ass DS9 regions
- I also have some FOC images in the NUV, which appear to show nothing but the star
- Now I am downloading the original HST datasets (not the HLA ones)
  - They have the c1f extension, which means they may not have been drizzled
** Papers
- [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Ap&SS.260..181G][Grosdidier et al (1998)]] First epoch HST images. Has some prescient comments:
  : We see many bright resolved knots of emission in the inner nebula, often surrounded by spherical, diffuse material (Fig. 2).
  So they seem to have notice the knots and the shocked shells.
- [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...562..753G][Grosdidier et al (2001)]] Analysis of same HST images, together with 
  CFHT spectra. They do lots of statistical analysis of structure functions and PDFs and try to relate it to turbulence. However, when they try and remove the stars from the HST image, they also remove the knots, which is not ideal.
