***** Strange behavior of the f470n filter
- Only the H_2 4.695 micron line is comfortably within the filter bandpass
- The H I lines are all too far outside the filter to contribute significantly
- This means that most of the emission must be continuum
  - That is exactly what is seen in Orion
  - Brightness of F470N and F480M are similar
  - Brightness is in MJy/sr, so that is per Hz

*** Alignment of JWST images

**** Try and do a better job of alignment
- We can use the scripts that I wrote for multifrecuencia class
- 

***** The HST images
- In the notebook analysis, I used the Ha image from the second epoch
  - ~11137_01~
- But we want to align the wide band images too, which I suspect are only the first epoch
  - ~06787_01~

****** Copy the original images to working directory
And give them shorter file names that include the year

This works the best. It looks like we have about 20 stars coincident between the two epochs in Ha

Now try the wide band. Increase threshold by factor of 10 since stars are brighter in this filter

This finds a superset of the same stars

Align to HST f657w image



** hst images
- [[file:MAST_wr124.json]] has a list  of the files that I have downloaded
  - These are the Level 3 products from the HLA of the WFPC2 observations, plus the Level 2 products from the FOC in the UV
  - On my laptop I have put the data files in file:/Users/will/Work/WR124-HST/

*** Available datasets
- I have got some images from HLA in the following filters
  - F656N
    - Two epochs
  - F555W
  - F675W
- They are badly contaminated by CRs, and I am not sure if these are the best observations or not
- It seems like the second F656N image I have is much better
  - Yes, this is the second epoch 2008-06
  - [2023-05-05 Fri] I am now using this image to mark the globules ass DS9 regions
- I also have some FOC images in the NUV, which appear to show nothing but the star
- Now I am downloading the original HST datasets (not the HLA ones)
  - They have the c1f extension, which means they may not have been drizzled
** Papers
- [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Ap&SS.260..181G][Grosdidier et al (1998)]] First epoch HST images. Has some prescient comments:
  : We see many bright resolved knots of emission in the inner nebula, often surrounded by spherical, diffuse material (Fig. 2).
  So they seem to have notice the knots and the shocked shells.
- [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...562..753G][Grosdidier et al (2001)]] Analysis of same HST images, together with 
  CFHT spectra. They do lots of statistical analysis of structure functions and PDFs and try to relate it to turbulence. However, when they try and remove the stars from the HST image, they also remove the knots, which is not ideal.
