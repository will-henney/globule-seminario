* Hydrodynamic simulations for Robberto globule project

- In the medium term, we would like to do some simulations of the wind-globule interactions in M1-67
- It would also be good to do some three-wind simulations


** Trying out PION on ghibli

*** Visualizing the output using pypion

- can be installed via pip
- but we still need to install Silo python bindings somehow

*** Test runs

**** Standard Wind2D test with released version
- [2023-08-10 Thu 21:05] This is running at the moment
- First file written at 20:57
- 20480 written at 21:00, which is 3 minutes
- In contrast, on my laptop it was 23:42 - 23:32, which is 10 minutes
- So ghibli with 16 cores is about 3 to 4 times faster than my laptop with 8 cores
- Finishes entire run in 25 min, as opposed to 2 hours that was adverised

*** Install "released" version of PION
- This is probably not worth it since it is incompatible with sundials 6
- Would need to downgrade to sundials 5
**** Issues encountered

***** Compiling extra libraries
- had to add extra lines to ~extra_libraries/install_all_libs.sh~
  #+begin_src sh
    HDF5_LIBS="/usr/local/Cellar/hdf5/1.12.2_2/include,/usr/local/Cellar/hdf5/1.12.2_2/lib"
  #+end_src
- and also
  #+begin_src sh
       PYTHON_CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/will/miniconda3/envs/py39/include/python3.9"\
  #+end_src

***** Weird problem with case insensitivity
- We have to do
  #+begin_src sh
    mv VERSION VERSION.txt
  #+end_src
  in ~extra_libraries/install_all_libs.sh~

***** Making sure compiler finds the homebrew libraries and includes
- The homebrew default location has changed on apple silicon macs
- In ~bin_parallel/Makefile~
  #+begin_src makefile
      INC += -I/opt/homebrew/include
  #+end_src
- and
  #+begin_src makefile
    LDFLAGS += -L/opt/homebrew/lib
  #+end_src
***** Incompatibility with sundials 6
- There were major API changes from version 5 to 6
  - See https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/tag/v6.0.0
- As a result, I needed to downgrade in homebrew to version 5
- These are the commands I ran to do this
  #+begin_src sh
     brew uninstall sundials
     brew tap-new $USER/local-sundials
     brew tap homebrew/core
     brew extract --version=5.8 sundials $USER/local-sundials
     brew install sundials@5.8
  #+end_src
  - This based on instructions found at https://cmichel.io/how-to-install-an-old-package-version-with-brew/

***** Make sure compiler uses C++ 14 extensions
In ~bin_parallel/Makefile~
#+begin_src makefile
  CXXFLAGS += -std=c++14

#+end_src

*** Install development version of PION
- Need to check which version of sundials we need
